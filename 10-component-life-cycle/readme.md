#Component Life Cycle
In this chapter, we will discuss component lifecycle methods.  
##Lifecycle Methods

- **componentWillMount** 
    is executed before rendering, on both the server and the client side.

- **componentDidMount** 
    is executed after the first render only on the client side. This is where AJAX requests and DOM or state updates should occur. This method is also used for integration with other JavaScript frameworks and any functions with delayed execution such as setTimeout or setInterval. We are using it to update the state so we can trigger the other lifecycle methods.

- **componentWillReceiveProps** 
    is invoked as soon as the props are updated before another render is called. We triggered it from setNewNumber when we updated the state.

- **shouldComponentUpdate** 
    should return true or false value. This will determine if the component will be updated or not. This is set to true by default. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return false value.

- **componentWillUpdate** 
    is called just before rendering.

- **componentDidUpdate** 
    is called just after rendering.

- **componentWillUnmount** 
    is called after the component is unmounted from the dom. We are unmounting our component in main.js.

In the following example, we will set the initial state in the constructor function.  
The setNewnumber is used to update the state. All the lifecycle methods are inside the Content component.
```
import React from 'react';
import Content from './Content';

class LifeCycle extends React.Component{

    constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = {
            data: 0
        };
        this.setNewNumber = this.setNewNumber.bind(this)
    };
    setNewNumber() {
        this.setState({data: this.state.data + 1})
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <button onClick = {this.setNewNumber}>INCREMENT</button>
                <Content myNumber = {this.state.data}></Content>
            </div>
        );
    }

}
export default LifeCycle;

import React from 'react';

class Content extends React.Component {
    componentWillMount() {
        console.log('Component WILL MOUNT!')
    }
    componentDidMount() {
        console.log('Component DID MOUNT!')
    }
    componentWillReceiveProps(newProps) {
        console.log('Component WILL RECIEVE PROPS!')
    }
    shouldComponentUpdate(newProps, newState) {
        return true;
    }
    componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
        console.log('Component WILL UPDATE!');
    }
    componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
        console.log('Component DID UPDATE!')
    }
    componentWillUnmount() {
        console.log('Component WILL UNMOUNT!')
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h3>{this.props.myNumber}</h3>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default Content;
```
Only **componentWillMount** and **componentDidMount** will be logged in the console, since we didn't update anything yet.  
When we click the **INCREMENT** button, the update will occur and other lifecycle methods will be triggered.

**Note** âˆ’ Lifecycle methods will always be invoked in the same order so it is a good practice to write it in the correct order as shown in the example.
