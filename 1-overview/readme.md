##React ─ Features 
- **JSX --** JSX is JavaScript syntax extension. It isn't necessary to use JSX in React
             development, but it is recommended
               
- **Components --**  React is all about components. You need to think of everything as
                  a component. This will help you maintain the code when working on larger scale
                  projects.  
                  
- **Unidirectional data flow and Flux −**  React implements one-way data flow which
                                            makes it easy to reason about your app. Flux is a pattern that helps keeping your
                                            data unidirectional.

##React ─ Advantages 
- Uses virtual DOM which is a JavaScript object. This will improve apps performance,
    since JavaScript virtual DOM is faster than the regular DOM
               
- Can be used on client and server side as well as with other frameworks 
                  
- Component and data patterns improve readability, which helps to maintain larger
  apps.  
  
##React ─ Limitations 
- Covers only the view layer of the app, hence you still need to choose other
  technologies to get a complete tooling set for development.
